    "# IOTA 101: Transactions\n",
    "A transaction is a smallest piece of data that can be broadcasted to the network. Each transaction consists of fixed 2673 trytes. Transactions (TXs) are basically of two types:\n",
    "* **Value TXs:** those transactions change ownership of IOTA tokens. Two possible states: spending TXs or receiving TXs\n",
    "* **Non-Value TXs:** those transactions include piece of data that can be broadcasted and read from the Tangle\n",
    "\n",
    "Transactions are broadcasted in an envelope called *Bundle*. Bundle may consist of multiple TXs. Bundle is processed by the Tangle as a single entity; meaning only the whole bundle is confirmed by the network (and all TXs within) or nothing. You have to prepare a bundle even if you broadcast single transaction only. Bundle is also described as *atomic* since every bundle includes all information needed to process it antonomously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each transaction includes several fields, let's name the most important ones:\n",
    "* **`Value`:** Value can be *positive* number = receiving IOTA tokens, *negative* number = spending IOTA tokens or *zero* = broadcasting only piece of data\n",
    "* **`Address`:** It is IOTA address that is associated with the given transaction. *Value* indicates whether it is an address of a receiver or a sender\n",
    "* **`Tag`:** It is an user-defined tag that can be used for searching, etc.\n",
    "* **`SignatureMessageFragment`:** This is the most lenghty attribute (2187 trytes) and could include: *transaction signature* based on private key in case it is a spending TX or *piece of data (message)* in case it is non-value TX. Alternatively it can be also left blank (in case of non-value TXs)\n",
    "* **`tTrunkTransaction` / `branchTransaction`:** Those two fields refer to some previous transactions in the Tangle (tips) that the given bundle is going to approve\n",
    "* **`Timestamp`:** TX timestamp. It is actually UNIX timestamp (UTC)\n",
    "![Creating TX in 5 steps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hribek25/IOTA101/master/Graphics/Creating_TX_in_5_steps.png \"By Petr Zizka\")\n",
    "\n",
    "A process of sending IOTA transaction can be summarized in 5 steps:\n",
    "* To create transation(s) with the given attributes: *value*, *address* and potentially also *tag* or *message*\n",
    "* To finalize a bundle that includes all transactions. Once the bundle is finalized no new transactions can be added. It basically means to generate a *bundle hash*\n",
    "* To search for two tips in the Tangle that you are going to validate. There is not a strict rule how to search them but it is generally recommended to leave it on a *tip selection algorithm* implemented on node's side \n",
    "* To do a *Proof-of-Work* for each transaction in the bundle. Result of POW is *Nonce* and *Transaction hash* stored with each transaction\n",
    "* Finally you need to *broadcast* the whole bundle to the network\n",
    "\n",
    "### A secret of a bundle\n",
    "There is a secret to be shared. You have to understand one important thing. Bundle is a top level construct that link all related transactions under one entity however the bundle itself is not broadcasted in fact. You still broadcast \"only\" collection of individual transactions instead. All transactions are recognized to be part of a bundle by the IOTA protocol however any data peering is based on individual transactions (in trytes).\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, a bundle can be reconstructed anytime from a collection of transactions via fields `bundle hash`, `current index` and `last index`."

In the first section, examples are really close to bare metal (still not too close:) to illustrate the whole process and describing implementation details wherever possible. It is also useful when you want to experiment with different settings at each step (hey \"non-existing tips\", looking at you).*\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Finalizing bundle\n",
    "Once all individual transactions are created it is time to prepare and finalize the bundle. While preparing the bundle you need at least to specify list of prepared transaction(s). In case of non-value transactions it is quite straightforward process. However, it is a bit more complicated in case of value transactions - please see later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finalizing the bundle consists of several tasks under the hood:\n",
    "* Each transaction is indexed. Attributes `current_index` / `last_index` are set\n",
    "* `Bundle hash` is generated (*Sponge function* + normalization) and assigned to each transaction\n",
    "* `signatureMessageFragment` is bascially copy of `message` field in case of non-value transactions\n",
    "* PyOTA library also checks whether the data in `message` field is larger than transaction allows (2187 trytes). If this is the case then it takes care of it and split your data into several transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "*Please note, finalizing the bundle also means you are no longer able to add new transactions to the bundle post the finalization process.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, `bundle hash` is a cryptographic \"fingerprint\" of all transactions in the bundle. It uniquely represents them and so as long as transactions are the same (incl their particular order) the `bundle hash` is also the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$BundleHash = fce(address, value, legacy tag, timestamp, current index, last index)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be wondering what is a difference between `tag` and `legacy_tag`. `Tag` includes actualy the tag that was defined during the transaction creation. `Legacy_tag` is also based on it however it is modified during the normalization process while bundle hashing to be sure that `bundle hash` is can be securely used while TX signing. That's why the `bundle hash` is sometimes refered as `normalized bundle hash`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bundle refers to the first transaction in collection as `tail_transaction`. You can perceive `tail transaction` as an official representative of the whole bundle while checking for confirmation status, etc. Remember, the bundle is an atomic entity and so whatever is done to bundle it applies to ALL transactions within."

This will be outsourced to an IOTA node and so it will be for the first time we interact with the network (via API call `get_transactions_to_approve`).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a `depth` parameter needed. It instructs a node how many milestones it should go in the past while confirming tips. The higher value the better to network however more resources needed. `Depth=3` is considered to be well-balanced compromise. Higher value than `depth=10` will probably throw an exception depending on node's configuration.\n",

    "### Creating and broadcasting transaction in a single call (you want send a transaction quickly)\n",
    "As mentioned above, PyOTA library (and almost any other IOTA-facing library) is able to encapsulate all implementation details and so you do not need to care of them anymore. It is usually based on *extended API calls* that were proposed to be included by IOTA Foundation to make developer's life easier (https://github.com/iotaledger/wiki/blob/master/api-proposal.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if using extended API calls you can still slightly control a level of your involvement in the whole process. From almost no involvement and fully automatic (*send_transfer()*) to semi-manual approach discussed above.\n",

    "There are some specifics you should consider while designing your app:\n",
    "* You are loosing a bit of control of individual steps of the process and you have to rely of some predefined parameters (tip selection algo, etc.)\n",
    "* If there is an exception raised during the process then you need to go back at beginning and restart the whole process again\n",
    "\n",
    "So it is basically your call to decide what works best for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now back to our exercise. Here comes a code that basically broadcasts transactions in a single call (*send_transfer()*) and you do not have to care of any implemenation details that are hidden under the hood."

    "## Value transactions\n",
    "Meta transactions were discussed in the previous chapter. This chapter describes `value transactions` which are transactions that transfer IOTA tokens between IOTA addresses. Tokens are fully premined and so number of tokens in the network is given. So `transfering tokens` means changing their ownership only.\n",
    "\n",
    "While preparing a bundle with `value transations` it is important to distinguish three different transaction types within a bundle:\n",
    "* **Input TXs:** those are transactions that *deducting* (spending) value from address(es). Those transactions have negative `value` field. They usually refer to `senders`\n",
    "* **Output TXs:** those are transactions that *adding* (receiving) value to address(es). Those transactions have positive `value` field. They usually refer to `recipients`\n",
    "* **Unspent/change TX:** technically speaking it is also *output* transaction that *adding* value however it usually refers to `senders` and so it is better to consider it separated from other output TXs\n",
    "\n",
    "All three types have to be part of each bundle otherwise you are under a risk of loosing IOTA tokens. In other words, each bundle should consists of at least one `input` TX, one `output` TX and one `unspent` TX. Total balance of the bundle should be zero since the number of tokens is the same, just token owners have been \"changed\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "* Alice owns 100 tokens (*input = 100*)\n",
    "* Alice is going to send 20 tokens to John from the address that includes 100 tokens of her (*Alice -100*)\n",
    "* John is going to receive 20 tokens from Alice (*output = 20*; *John +20*)\n",
    "* Alice still owns 80 tokens after the transaction (*unspent = 80*; *Alice +80*)\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice's bundle should look like:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "Input - Output & = \\ Unspent \\\\\n",
    "Input - Output - Unspent & = \\ 0 \\\\\n",
    "100 - 20 - 80 & = \\ 0\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Alice has to \"put\" all 100 tokens in the bundle while she is going to actually spend only 20 tokens? The reason is that IOTA protocol uses one-time signature scheme (OTS) for transaction signing while spending tokens. And with every signing process a half of a private key of the given address is revealed. That's why no one should ever spend tokens from the same address again.\n",
    "![Never reuse address](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hribek25/IOTA101/17cde67e39b66dd7c481577497e08399fc888f96/Graphics/never-reuse-address-again.png \"By Petr Zizka\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spending tokens\n",
    "*Please note: for a purpose of this chapter we are going to switch to a test network called `devnet`. It is the testing Tangle. Tokens are not real and everything you do have no implication to the mainnet at all. However it is stil powered by standard node software and so technicaly speaking it behaves like the mainnet. If you need more info regarding devnet please refer to [the official documentation](https://docs.iota.org/introduction/testnet/introduction).*\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything what has been mentioned in the previous chapter focused on `non-value` transations is still valid also in case of value transactions however there are several additional tasks you should take care of. Needless to say, IOTA libraries (PyOTA and others) are ready to help you and are able to hide all implementation details in case you would like to. In this case I would encourage everyone to prefer a functionality that is offered by extended API calls, such as `send_transfer`. Experimenting with value transactions and trying to tweak them does not seem to be a good idea (on the mainnet).\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, even in this chapter I am going to describe main tasks that are performed under the hood to be able to understand the whole concept.\n",
