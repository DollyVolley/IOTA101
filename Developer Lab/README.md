*The IOTA Developer Lab* is a side-project of the project *IOTA Developer Essentials*:
* **IOTA Developer Essentials** provides a Python-based content focused on IOTA protocol
* **IOTA Developer Lab** provides infrastructure services that adapt Python-based content also to other languages and should also provide an interactive environment for anybody who would like to get a realtime experience with the code. You can play with all code snippets directly in your web browser - that's the main goal of the project.

The IOTA Developer Essentials and IOTA Developer Lab are long-term projects. The main goal is to provide a comprehensive onboarding information to anybody interested in the IOTA protocol. It will cover much more chapters, more code snippets and it will also cover more languages. There is a [roadmap](https://github.com/Hribek25/IOTA101/projects/1) available. Your kind donations will support the vision pushing forward. Thank you.
