The IOTA Developer Essentials and IOTA Developer Lab are long-term projects. The main goal is to provide a comprehensive onboarding information to anybody interested in the IOTA protocol. It will cover much more chapters, more code snippets and it will also cover more languages. There is a [roadmap](https://github.com/Hribek25/IOTA101/projects/1) available. Your kind donations will support the vision pushing forward. Thank you.
