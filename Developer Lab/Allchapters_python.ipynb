    "# IOTA 101: Essentials and IOTA Terminology\n",
    "IOTA is an open-source Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) with the following characteristics: *permissionless*, *feeless* and *trustless*. In contrary to the blockchain technology, the IOTA transactions are stored in a form of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) called *the Tangle*.\n",
    "![Blockchain and Tangle comparison](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hribek25/IOTA101/master/Graphics/Blockchain_And_Tangle_iota_org.png \"(c) iota.org\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transactions\n",
    "Transactions (TXs) in the tangle can be of two types:\n",
    "* **Value transactions** (*IOTA token* represents funds in case of value transactions)\n",
    "* **Zero-value transactions** (aka meta transactions)\n",
    "\n",
    "Every transaction is attached to a specific *IOTA Address*.\n",
    "There are no miners with IOTA protocol to validate transactions. The *consensus* is achieved by network participants themselves. Each participant that wants to broadcast a new transaction has to approve 2 past transactions and basically attach transaction as a children node. Transactions without children transactions (waiting to be confirmed) are called *tips*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Seed, private key and address\n",
    "Pair of unique IOTA address and corresponding *Private Key* is determistically generated from a *Seed*. You can generate (2<sup>53</sup> - 1) different addresses/private keys based on one Seed. Anybody can send anything to the given address however only Seed owner can send funds from IOTA address since only the Seed owner is able to generate corresponding *Private Key*.\n",
    "\n",
    "IOTA protocol uses One-Time Signature (OTS) for \"verifying\" whether private key matches to the given address, specifically Winternitz OTS (WOTS). So *Private Key* (specifically *Key Fragments* of the private key) is the key component while signing transactions using WOTS.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's the reason why nobody should use IOTA address that have been already funds spent from. New IOTA address (of the given seed) should be generated and used instead. Please note, it applies only to fund-spending. Receiving funds/data is totaly fine even multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize the key concept here. Only *Seed* is needed to be stored somewhere. Everything else can be safely generated from it: private key as well as address.\n",
    "\n",
    "## IOTA nodes\n",
    "The Tangle runs on a *distributed network* of IOTA nodes called *mainnet*. There are also other separate \"Tangles\" serving for specific purposes: Devnet, SPAMnet, etc. You can interact with the network via public nodes using collection of public *API calls*. You can interact with any public node of the given network since all nodes \"gossiping\" all TXs across the whole network. Nodes are powered by a reference piece of software called *IRI* (IOTA Reference Implementation) **as of now**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to mention that you do not exchange any sensitive information such as *Seed* with a node. Every sensitive operation such as TX signing is done on client's side and node is just a \"messenger\" that delivers your TX to the IOTA network.\n",
    "![Centralized, decentralized and distributed models](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hribek25/IOTA101/master/Graphics/Centralized-decentralized-and-distributed-network-models-by-Paul-Baran-1964-part-of-a.png \"(c) Paul Baran, researchgate\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## Custom node\n",
    "You can even run own IOTA node and actively participate to the whole network. There is a big advantage for developers in that case. Actual implementation of IRI  provides an usefull real-time information via messaging platform called ZeroMQ and so developers can leverage that.\n",
    "\n",
    "## API calls\n",
    "There are ready-made libraries for major programming languages available and so you have more developer-friendly way how to interact with the IOTA network. Anyway, you can interact with IOTA network using pure API calls without any library. It is up to you.\n"

    "## Ternary\n",
    "It is difficult to avoid mentioning *Ternary numeral system* while discussing IOTA at all. IOTA is based on ternary system under the hood and so you have got to be aware of some basic terminology in this respect. You are going to face this fact in any developer-related IOTA guide out there.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ternary\n",
    "Ternary has three as its base (aka base 3) as opposted to *binary* which is base 2. Instead of two states (0 and 1) it recognizes three states (for ex. -1, 0, 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trit\n",
    "One *Trite* is analogous to one *bit*. It is the smallest digit and has three states. Trit = **Tri**nary dig**it**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tryte\n",
    "*Tryte* consists of three *trits* meaning 27 combinations.\n",
    "$$3^3=27$$\n",
    "\n",
    "You will recognize soon that almost everything is encoded in *Trytes* in the IOTA world. Tryte is visually represented using [A..Z] alphabets and number 9. One character represents one tryte (here comes 27 possible characters again). *Don't get mad, IOTA libraries are going to help us.*\n",

    "# IOTA 101: Basic network interactions\n",
    "The tutorial is based on IOTA libraries called *PyOTA* for Python, *IOTA Javascript Library (@iota/core)* for JavaScript and Tangle.Net for C# (.NET 4.x and .NET Standard). It encapsulates all official IRI API calls and it can be installed via `pip` in Python environment, via `npm` in JS environment and via `NuGet` in case of .NET environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reader is also encouraged to try a ready-made environment via *IOTA Developer Lab* project (at lab.iota101.info) where anyone can run a code directly in a web browser. When viewing it interactively then just select a code snippet and hit `ctrl + enter` which executes it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, most of the information in the tutorial is language-agnostic and so only particular interfaces slightly differ across different IOTA libraries. Top-level details are the same regardless programming language you are going to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A few words about specific IOTA libraries\n",
    "### Python\n",
    "*PyOTA* is well maintained and understandable IOTA library that can be reached at https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.lib.py. It is very good starting point for beginners.\n",
    "It can be installed via `pip`:\n",
    "```pip install pyota```\n",
    "\n",
    "### JavaScipt\n",
    "Official IOTA Javascript library (v1.0) is currently in beta however all main functions are working just fine, please see https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.js/. It is very modular and so you can install only components you really need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Main component is @iota/core and can be installed via `npm`:\n",
    "```npm install @iota/core```\n",
    "\n",
    "As with everything in NodeJS, most of the tasks are asynchronous and they are chained via `callbacks` or `promise`. Snippets below leverage `promise` chaining.\n",
    "### C# (.NET)\n",
    "*Tangle.Net* is well maintained IOTA library for .NET and can be reached at https://github.com/Felandil/tangle-.net.\n",
    "It can be installed via `NuGet`:\n",
    "```nuget.exe install tangle.net```\n",
    "\n",
    "Snippets below uses synchronous functions however the library provides also asynchronous (async postfix) version.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conneting to IOTA nodes\n",
    "Before you can interact with the IOTA network you need an URL of the running IOTA node. There are dozen of directories of public nodes available, feel free to google them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a sake of this tutorial I use a project *thetangle.org*. It is a load ballancer that provides you an access to a pool of participanting nodes effortlessly.\n",
    "* *Advantage:* you do not have to care about public nodes and whether they are running or not\n",
    "* *Disadvantage:* you do not know in advance which specific node will process your API call. So in some respect results of API calls may differ since some API calls depend on specific node, such as GetNodeInfo().\n",
    "\n",
    "### Node is not synced\n",
    "Even if a node is up and running it may not be fully prepared to process your API calls correctly. The node should be \"synced\", meaning should be aware of all TXs in the Tangle. It is better to avoid not fully synced nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Health checking\n",
    "Once you connect to an IOTA node you should be able to send API calls. However it is better to do some checks in advance in order to find out whether the given node is in good condition or not. IOTA nodes can be run by anyone and so health check is always a good practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic healthcheck can be done via *GetNodeInfo()* API call. It returns a basic information about the given IOTA node."

    "*Please note, finalizing the bundle also means you are no longer able to add new transactions to the bundle post the finalization process.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, `bundle hash` is a cryptographic \"fingerprint\" of all transactions in the bundle. It uniquely represents them and so as long as transactions are the same (incl their particular order) the `bundle hash` is also the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$BundleHash = fce(address, value, legacy tag, timestamp, current index, last index)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be wondering what is a difference between `tag` and `legacy_tag`. `Tag` includes actualy the tag that was defined during the transaction creation. `Legacy_tag` is also based on it however it is modified during the normalization process while bundle hashing to be sure that `bundle hash` is can be securely used while TX signing. That's why the `bundle hash` is sometimes refered as `normalized bundle hash`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bundle refers to the first transaction in collection as `tail_transaction`. You can perceive `tail transaction` as an official representative of the whole bundle while checking for confirmation status, etc. Remember, the bundle is an atomic entity and so whatever is done to bundle it applies to ALL transactions within."

    "As mentioned above, IOTA-facing libraries are able to encapsulate all implementation details and so you do not need to care of them anymore. It is usually based on *extended API calls* that were proposed to be included by IOTA Foundation to make developer's life easier (https://github.com/iotaledger/wiki/blob/master/api-proposal.md).\n",

    "* You are loosing a bit of control of individual steps of the process and you have to rely of some predefined parameters (tip selection algo, etc.)\n",
    "* If there is an exception raised during the process then you need to go back at beginning and restart the whole process again\n",
    "\n",
    "So it is basically your call to decide what works best for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now back to our exercise. Here comes a code that basically broadcasts transactions in a single call (`send_transfer()`) and you do not have to care of any implemenation details that are hidden under the hood."

    "## Value transactions\n",
    "Meta transactions were discussed in the previous chapter. This chapter describes `value transactions` which are transactions that transfer IOTA tokens between IOTA addresses. Tokens are fully premined and so number of tokens in the network is given. So `transfering tokens` means changing their ownership only.\n",
    "\n",
    "While preparing a bundle with `value transations` it is important to distinguish three different transaction types within a bundle:\n",
    "* **Input TXs:** those are transactions that *deducting* (spending) value from address(es). Those transactions have negative `value` field. They usually refer to `senders`\n",
    "* **Output TXs:** those are transactions that *adding* (receiving) value to address(es). Those transactions have positive `value` field. They usually refer to `recipients`\n",
    "* **Unspent/change TX:** technically speaking it is also *output* transaction that *adding* value however it usually refers to `senders` and so it is better to consider it separated from other output TXs\n",
    "\n",
    "All three types have to be part of each bundle otherwise you are under a risk of loosing IOTA tokens. In other words, each bundle should consists of at least one `input` TX, one `output` TX and one `unspent` TX. Total balance of the bundle should be zero since the number of tokens is the same, just token owners have been \"changed\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "* Alice owns 100 tokens (*input = 100*)\n",
    "* Alice is going to send 20 tokens to John from the address that includes 100 tokens of her (*Alice -100*)\n",
    "* John is going to receive 20 tokens from Alice (*output = 20*; *John +20*)\n",
    "* Alice still owns 80 tokens after the transaction (*unspent = 80*; *Alice +80*)\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice's bundle should look like:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "Input - Output & = \\ Unspent \\\\\n",
    "Input - Output - Unspent & = \\ 0 \\\\\n",
    "100 - 20 - 80 & = \\ 0\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Alice has to \"put\" all 100 tokens in the bundle while she is going to actually spend only 20 tokens? The reason is that IOTA protocol uses one-time signature scheme (OTS) for transaction signing while spending tokens. And with every signing process a half of a private key of the given address is revealed. That's why no one should ever spend tokens from the same address again.\n",
    "![Never reuse address](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hribek25/IOTA101/17cde67e39b66dd7c481577497e08399fc888f96/Graphics/never-reuse-address-again.png \"By Petr Zizka\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spending tokens\n",
    "*Please note: for a purpose of this chapter we are going to switch to a test network called `devnet`. It is the testing Tangle. Tokens are not real and everything you do have no implication to the mainnet at all. However it is stil powered by standard node software and so technicaly speaking it behaves like the mainnet. If you need more info regarding devnet please refer to [the official documentation](https://docs.iota.org/introduction/testnet/introduction).*\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything what has been mentioned in the previous chapter focused on `non-value` transations is still valid also in case of value transactions however there are several additional tasks you should take care of. Needless to say, IOTA libraries (PyOTA and others) are ready to help you and are able to hide all implementation details in case you would like to. In this case I would encourage everyone to prefer a functionality that is offered by extended API calls, such as `send_transfer`. Experimenting with value transactions and trying to tweak them does not seem to be a good idea (on the mainnet).\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, even in this chapter I am going to describe main tasks that are performed under the hood to be able to understand the whole concept.\n",

    "Let's review all transactions that has been prepared and sent eventually:\n",
    "* The first transaction `current_index=0` is the `output TX` that basically adds tokens to some address\n",
    "* Transactions `current_index=1` and `current_index=2` are two parts of the same transaction - `Input TX`. This transaction deducts tokens from the address(es). You can see negative `value` in the transaction `current_index=1`\n",
    "* Why there are two parts? Since the transaction spends tokens it has to be signed in order to validate the ownership. Signature is generated from the private key and the signature can be observed in the field `signature_message_fragment`. Here is the thing. Do you remember when different `security levels` were discussed? There are three security levels available and the given level has the direct impact on length of the signature. Since `signature_message_fragment` is of the fixed size, if `SL>1` then the transaction has to be split to be able to accommodate full signature.\n",
    "* The last transaction `current_index=3` moves unspent tokens to the first unused address of the given seed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following tasks have to be done behind the curtain in addition to the standard transaction preparation process:\n",
    "* Search for address(es) with some balance until total amount of tokens available is large enough to be spent. You can use more input addresses if needed\n",
    "* If there would be some unspent amount of tokens then also search for the first unused address\n",
    "* Spending transactions (Input TX) has to be properly signed and split in case of `SL>1`\n",
    "* There is also some quick check performed whether resulting number of tokens is zero (no more tokens, no less tokens. Number of tokens has to be balanced).\n",
    "\n",
    "So basically all steps we tried in the chapter had to be done also behind the curtain while using `send_transfer` extended API call. You can also see that some of those operations may be quite expensive in terms of time while being completely stateless. In real world applications it would be better to save some states (index of last address, used addresses, etc.) to avoid too many expensive operations.\n",
