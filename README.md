These notebooks provide a self-study introduction to IOTA protocol and are designed for developers and tech enthusiasts who would like to get quickly familiar with the IOTA. Technical-related information is accompanied with interactive code snippets to help you to quickly jump on the platform and be ready to build own solutions based on it.

> Motto of this tutorial: "Let's start with baby steps before we can try and fly."

## Main Goal
Main goal of this guide is to provide a comprehensive yet well-balanced proportion of deep-dive technical information and essentials.

## Getting Started
There are several chapters available. If you are not familiar with IOTA then it is highly recommended to follow them in the particular order to understand all important IOTA concepts properly. Otherwise you may get quickly confused later.

## Code Snippets
Code snippets are currently based on Python and NodeJs. Since Python is very descriptive language and easy to understand, I believe the tutorial is basically understandable to anyone. Anyway, all important IOTA concepts are described in language-agnostic way and so you would be able to use any language of your choice.

Interested to see what is the overall code base coverage breaked down to a specific language? The following page provides you such an info. Needless to say, we are working hard to be sure there is no language that would be a second-class citizen.

Even if you ignore code snippets completely there is still plenty info left.

The tutotorial is accompanied by *IOTA Developer Lab* and so you can play with all code snippets directly in your web browser, please see the next chapter. Feel free to experiment with the prepared code snippets and get your hands dirty. It is a best way how to get familiar quickly.

## Viewing and running
### Interactive Mode
There exists a side project called *IOTA Developer Lab* that is built on top of *IOTA Developer Essentials*. The project provides infrastructure services for you to be able to get an interactive experience with all code snippets.

### Static Mode
If you prefer a static experience (for printing purposes, for instance) you can reach the given notebooks as a Complete Textbook that is compiled from all source materials:

Everything is tightly linked together and so you can easily switch between different languages for instance, or you can share links to specific chapters, code snippets, etc. All links are static so feel free to share them.

The IOTA Developer Essentials and IOTA Developer Lab are long-term projects. The main goal is to provide a comprehensive onboarding information to anybody interested in the IOTA protocol. It will cover much more chapters, more code snippets and it will also cover more languages. There is a [roadmap](https://github.com/Hribek25/IOTA101/projects/1) available. Your kind donations will support the vision pushing forward. Thank you.
