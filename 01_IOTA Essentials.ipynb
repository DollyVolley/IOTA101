    "# IOTA 101: Essentials and IOTA Terminology\n",
    "IOTA is an open-source Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) with the following characteristics: *permissionless*, *feeless* and *trustless*. In contrary to the blockchain technology, the IOTA transactions are stored in a form of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) called *the Tangle*.\n",
    "![Blockchain and Tangle comparison](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hribek25/IOTA101/master/Graphics/Blockchain_And_Tangle_iota_org.png \"(c) iota.org\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transactions\n",
    "Transactions (TXs) in the tangle can be of two types:\n",
    "* **Value transactions** (*IOTA token* represents funds in case of value transactions)\n",
    "* **Zero-value transactions** (aka meta transactions)\n",
    "\n",
    "Every transaction is attached to a specific *IOTA Address*.\n",
    "There are no miners with IOTA protocol to validate transactions. The *consensus* is achieved by network participants themselves. Each participant that wants to broadcast a new transaction has to approve 2 past transactions and basically attach transaction as a children node. Transactions without children transactions (waiting to be confirmed) are called *tips*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Seed, private key and address\n",
    "Pair of unique IOTA address and corresponding *Private Key* is determistically generated from a *Seed*. You can generate (2<sup>53</sup> - 1) different addresses/private keys based on one Seed. Anybody can send anything to the given address however only Seed owner can send funds from IOTA address since only the Seed owner is able to generate corresponding *Private Key*.\n",
    "\n",
    "IOTA protocol uses One-Time Signature (OTS) for \"verifying\" whether private key matches to the given address, specifically Winternitz OTS (WOTS). So *Private Key* (specifically *Key Fragments* of the private key) is the key component while signing transactions using WOTS.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's the reason why nobody should use IOTA address that have been already funds spent from. New IOTA address (of the given seed) should be generated and used instead. Please note, it applies only to fund-spending. Receiving funds/data is totaly fine even multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize the key concept here. Only *Seed* is needed to be stored somewhere. Everything else can be safely generated from it: private key as well as address.\n",
    "\n",
    "## IOTA nodes\n",
    "The Tangle runs on a *distributed network* of IOTA nodes called *mainnet*. There are also other separate \"Tangles\" serving for specific purposes: Devnet, SPAMnet, etc. You can interact with the network via public nodes using collection of public *API calls*. You can interact with any public node of the given network since all nodes \"gossiping\" all TXs across the whole network. Nodes are powered by a reference piece of software called *IRI* (IOTA Reference Implementation) **as of now**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to mention that you do not exchange any sensitive information such as *Seed* with a node. Every sensitive operation such as TX signing is done on client's side and node is just a \"messenger\" that delivers your TX to the IOTA network.\n",
    "![Centralized, decentralized and distributed models](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hribek25/IOTA101/master/Graphics/Centralized-decentralized-and-distributed-network-models-by-Paul-Baran-1964-part-of-a.png \"(c) Paul Baran, researchgate\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## Custom node\n",
    "You can even run own IOTA node and actively participate to the whole network. There is a big advantage for developers in that case. Actual implementation of IRI  provides an usefull real-time information via messaging platform called ZeroMQ and so developers can leverage that.\n",
    "\n",
    "## API calls\n",
    "There are ready-made libraries for major programming languages available and so you have more developer-friendly way how to interact with the IOTA network. Anyway, you can interact with IOTA network using pure API calls without any library. It is up to you.\n"

    "## Ternary\n",
    "It is difficult to avoid mentioning *Ternary numeral system* while discussing IOTA at all. IOTA is based on ternary system under the hood and so you have got to be aware of some basic terminology in this respect. You are going to face this fact in any developer-related IOTA guide out there.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ternary\n",
    "Ternary has three as its base (aka base 3) as opposted to *binary* which is base 2. Instead of two states (0 and 1) it recognizes three states (for ex. -1, 0, 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trit\n",
    "One *Trite* is analogous to one *bit*. It is the smallest digit and has three states. Trit = **Tri**nary dig**it**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tryte\n",
    "*Tryte* consists of three *trits* meaning 27 combinations.\n",
    "$$3^3=27$$\n",
    "\n",
    "You will recognize soon that almost everything is encoded in *Trytes* in the IOTA world. Tryte is visually represented using [A..Z] alphabets and number 9. One character represents one tryte (here comes 27 possible characters again). *Don't get mad, IOTA libraries are going to help us.*\n",

    "The tutorial is based on official IOTA libraries called *PyOTA* and *IOTA Javascript Library - iota.lib.js*. It encapsulates all official IRI API calls and it can be installed via `pip` in a Python environment or via `npm` in a NodeJS environment. Reader is also encouraged to try a ready-made environment via *IOTA Developer Lab* project where anyone can run a code directly in web browser. When viewing it interactively then just select a code snippet and hit `ctrl + enter` which executes it.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Conneting to IOTA nodes\n",
    "Before you can interact with the IOTA network you need an URL of the running IOTA node. There are dozen of directories of public nodes available, feel free to google them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a sake of this tutorial I use a project *thetangle.org*. It is a load ballancer that provides you an access to a pool of participanting nodes effortlessly.\n",
    "* *Advantage:* you do not have to care about public nodes and whether they are running or not\n",
    "* *Disadvantage:* you do not know in advance which specific node will process your API call. So in some respect results of API calls may differ since some API calls depend on specific node, such as GetNodeInfo().\n",
    "\n",
    "### Node is not synced\n",
    "Even if a node is up and running it may not be fully prepared to process your API calls correctly. The node should be \"synced\", meaning should be aware of all TXs in the Tangle. It is better to avoid not fully synced nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Health checking\n",
    "Once you connect to an IOTA node you should be able to send API calls. However it is better to do some checks in advance in order to find out whether the given node is in good condition or not. IOTA nodes can be run by anyone and so health check is always a good practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic healthcheck can be done via *GetNodeInfo()* API call. It returns a basic information about the given IOTA node."
